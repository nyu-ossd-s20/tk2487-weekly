title: Week 3:Firefox Extension Project and Presentations
---


This week, my group and I successfully finished our dice roll and coin flip extension and my teammate even gave it a stylish flair using neon colors. We also added a new animation for the coin flip to accompany the dice roll and we made the interface look cleaner and easy to use. Everyone did equal amounts of work and our communication improved since last week, making the process easier and enjoyable. From a simple concept with a simple design, we kept building on top of it to create something a little more complex and flashy and came out with something really polished and satisfying.

As for the presentations, I was particularly surprised by some of the projects, especially the table of contents extension because it looked like something I would use daily. It was eye-opening because I realized that there were many useful ideas that could be implemented with the right plan and team. After seeing every team's demo, I started regretting the fact that we weren't super ambitious with our project (although we were all pretty new to JavaScript). Either way I came out of this assignment with useful knowledge and, more importantly, an eagerness to contribute to something bigger and meaningful.
