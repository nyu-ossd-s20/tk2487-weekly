## Group Standup Reports
This week we had our group standup report and we basically just updated the class on what we had done and what we were up to.
Our group talked about the installer one of our groupmates made, a few small grammar fixes, and a default file opening fix. 
As for me, I talked about the pull request I had made (find specific word count) that got denied because it was editing code 
from a file from a third party editor. The main contributor said while it would be a nice feature to add, the code would
get overwritten anyway when they updated to a newer version of the third party editor. So while it was pretty disappointing
to not get my pull request merged it served as a lesson to stay away from third party program files. Now I am just looking 
for more features to implement in preparation for next week's presentation.
