title: Week 8:Spring Break

## Spring Break
This week was spring break so not much happened. Our group was supposed to meetup during the break but we postponed it to this Monday 
because of the whole quarantine situation. Most likely all group meetups will be online now and starting from Monday we will, as a group,
search for potential issues that we each can work on. Whether it be documentation or code we have yet to discuss but we will probably
start with documentation issues as a starter and as we get more familiar with the code we can start diving into the actual code base. 
Other than that this week was pretty uneventful.
