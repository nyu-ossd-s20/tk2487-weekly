## Group Project Update
This week during our group meeting, we hashed out the plan for the next week. Some of what we talked about included pooling all possible
and known issues as well as distributing that work. We also talked about having a large group contribution paired with a small individual
contribution to make things fair for everyone. So far we have a plan fleshed out to work on UI features that would make sense in a text
editor like Inky and each person is working on one part of the UI. We are mainly focusing on word count and knot counts (which are like
story branches) as well as choice counts. As soon as we can figure out which files are directly related to these functions it should be 
pretty straightforward.
