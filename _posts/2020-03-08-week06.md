title: Week 6:Project Evaluations and Data Preservation
---

## Guest Speaker
This week Vicky Steeves visited again to talk about data preservation and how important it is to have data stored. One of the interesting
things she talked about was that scientific research data from 30+ years ago were mostly gone because they had not properly stored
their data, a huge impact from such a minor detail. Her insistence on data preservation really hammered the point home that data is fragile and without taking the proper steps, it can completely disappear.  


## Project Evaluations
As for project evaluations, this week was my first week actually looking at projects on github. I was tasked with reviewing godot and 
opentelemetry and both projects had an intensive code base that required extensive knowledge of the project. which was pretty daunting.
Both communities seemed very welcoming in their conversations in open/closed issues and their repositories were all very well setup and 
organized that a guide for contributing was super easy to find. As for my contributions, I am leaning towards godot because it is 
something that interests me and something that I don't mind learning on my free time. Opentelemetry, on the other hand, just doesn't
seem like a project meant for a user like me so I don't think I will contribute to that. In the end, this experience was like a first
step into open source contributions.
