## Group Project
So after our decision to swap to Inky we went ahead and tried to install the developer environment on our personal computers but we all 
ran into some problems. We asked the project community about the issue and while they were responsive they could not fix our problem.
Luckily, Carsen found a solution and shared it with us so we could successfully install the environment and we decided that this fix 
could be one of our contributions to the project. As for other potential issues, we learned that the issue pages wasn't properly updated
and most of them were already solved but not marked 'solved.' Because of this we consulted the project creator and he gave us a list
of open issues and other feature requests. We were also thinking of proposing some features that would make the UI nicer and clean-looking 
but Professor Klukowska warned us about being too forward with feature proposals that were not specifically asked for. So far this
project is looking very promising, especially since the community is so helpful and active to our group.
