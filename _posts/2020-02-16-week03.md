title: Week 3:Firefox Extension Project and Presentations
---


This week, my group and I successfully finished our dice roll and coin flip extension and my teammate even gave it a stylish flair using neon colors. The end product looked really polished so we were all satisfied with our work. As for the presentations, I was particularly surprised by some of the projects, especially the table of contents extension because it looked like something I would use daily. It was eye-opening because I realized that there were many useful ideas that could be implemented with the right plan and team. After seeing every team's demo, I started regretting the fact that we weren't super ambitious with our project (although we were all pretty new to json). Either way I came out of this assignment with useful knowledge and, more importantly, an eagerness to contribute to something bigger and meaningful.
