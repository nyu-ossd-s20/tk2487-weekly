title: Week 9:Swap to Inky
---

## Group Project
This week after our group had our first meeting, we decided that the project we initially agreed to work on (Godot) was extremely
complicated and required many hours of research and dedication to learn the code base. We saw that if we were to work on this project,
most of our contributions would be related to documentation, which is great but we also wanted to contribute some code. Because of this,
we searched for a new potential project and settled on a text narrative adventure editor called Inky. After checking out some of the 
issues and the code base itself, we found that Inky seemed doable. The next step was to enter the community and get a feel of the
developers' attitude towards the project itself (how active / alive the community is) and so we entered their Discord channel and 
introduced ourselves and asked them about their project. We got a pretty swift response from one of the creators and they assured us 
that they were happy to help with any troubles we encountered. Now, the only steps left are to create a project evaluation for Inky
and then we can finally start contributing to it.
