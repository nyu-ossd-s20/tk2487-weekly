title: Week 11: Group Project Presentations
---

## Presentations
This week our class had our group stand up reports where we had to introduce our project and report how far we've gotten. Although our
group didn't have time to go this week, I learned a lot from listening to others speak on their progress and their next steps. It gave
our team a few ideas in terms of goals and also gave us an idea of how far we were compared to other groups. Turns out we were slightly 
above the curve because we had already established contact with many of the developers of the project Inky and we had received some
feature requests as well as open issues directly from the community. As for our contributions we are deciding how to split the issues 
among our group members so that each person is comfortable with the difficulty of that particular issue.
