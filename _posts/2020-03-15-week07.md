## Godot
This week our team decided to work on Godot because it was one of the projects we all had in our common interests and because
the language used was something we were familiar with. The others used JavaScript/HTML but Godot uses C++ primarily which 
makes it easier for us to contribute. After deciding on what to work on we looked for a few problems we could potentially
work on and we set up the development environment. We singled out some beginner friendly problems and decided to talk about
how we go about fixing the issues together every Wednesday around noon using Slack. Despite the virus situation making it
difficult to meet in person, collaborating online shouldn't be a problem as we can just as easily communicate through Skype
or Discord. As for the remote class on Zoom, it went much better than expected. I even thought it was better than in class 
sessions simply because the audio was clear which made it easier to pay attention.
