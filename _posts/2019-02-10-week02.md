title: Week 2:Firefox Addon Group Project
---


This week my group and I worked on a firefox extension that lets the user roll a dice or flip a coin at any time. At first the idea seemed daunting because I had never written Javascript before this course but after analyzing the first class exercise, I got the idea of what each line of code did and how it showed up on the webpage. After playing around with the base code in the exercise, I figured out how to adapt them to fit our project idea.

My teammates then set up the base for the extension as well as the dice roll and coin flip logic while I implemented the 3D dice roll animation. As of now, our extension is 95% done as we just need to discuss the format (text, color scheme) of the extension.  

This project, although simple, has introduced me to the possibilities of Javascript and has helped knock down that first barrier to writing in this language. Aside from JS knowledge, I also learned that I prefer to discuss project matters face to face because Slack messaging seemed a little slow as not everyone checked it daily. Despite that, everyone was cooperative and did their part which made this project enjoyable.
