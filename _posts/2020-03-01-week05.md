title: Week 5:Project Evaluations and Guest Speaker
---

## Jupyter
This week I wasn't present for the day we got in groups and did project evaluations so I went ahead and just took a look at one of the projects myself (Jupyter). This project in particular presents new users with clean question and answer format on contributing to make beginners of open source feel welcomed. They have a [developer guide](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer-docs/index.html#developer-guide) for code contributions, [documentation guide](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contrib_docs/index.html#documentation-guide) for documenting contributions, and even a [community guide](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html#community-guide) for engaging in meetups and other community events. As I'm not familar at all with Jupyter and its inner workings, if I were to contribute to this it would have to be documentation and community related for now.

## Bloomberg Guest Speaker
An interesting thing I learned from Kevin Fleming's talk was how his company utilized open source. I thought for sure any private company, especially a large one like Bloomberg, would keep everything behind closed doors but the fact that they are open to letting the public see their code is very interesting. The only barrier to contributing, as Mr. Fleming explained, was trying to recreate the environment to run the project, which requires specific knowledge on it.
