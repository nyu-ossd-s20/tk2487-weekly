title: Week 15:Project Presentation

## Presentation
This week our group did our presentation on Inky. Because we didn't have many concrete contributions, we talked a bit about 
the pitfalls of choosing Inky as our project and how we hope to do better. We each talked about our own small contributions
that we made as well as communications with the community. Overall, it seemed to be a successful presentation and, even though,
as a group we are kind of lacking merged contributions, we still have some unpulled work to show in our project files so I'm 
not too worried. At the moment I am working on some more feature requests for Inky to maybe get another contribution before the
semester ends.
